// The tennis society has contracted you to build a scoreboard to display
// the current score during tennis games. Rules:

//1) A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total
// and at least two points more than the opponent.

//2) The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis:
// scores from zero to three points are described as
// “Love”, “Fifteen”, “Thirty”, and “Forty” respectively.

//3) If at least three points have been scored by each player,
// and the scores are equal, the score is “Deuce”.

//4) If at least three points have been scored by each side
// and a player has one more point than his opponent,
// the score of the game is “Advantage” for the player in the lead.
