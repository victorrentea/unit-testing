# Spring reuses the context in a cache between test classes
# To optimize Spring Context reuse between test classes:
# 1: uncomment next line and rerun **all** your tests
logging.level.org.springframework.test.context.cache=DEBUG
# 2: Find the last line like this, and see missCount=???? x 10..30 seconds
# Spring test ApplicationContext cache statistics: [... size = 2, maxSize = 32, parentContextCount = 0, hitCount = 102, missCount = 4]
# 3: Find all lines containing "Storing ApplicationContext". The test class that ran before it forced Spring to reboot.
